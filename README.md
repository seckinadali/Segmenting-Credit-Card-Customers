# Segmenting Credit Card Customers

In this project we work with a data set that contains information about a credit card company's customers. We segment the customers into different groups so that different business strategies can be applied to each group. We use K-means algorithm to achieve this task.

The data set was provided by Dataquest as part of one of their guided projects, it can be accessed via [this link from their community forum](https://community.dataquest.io/uploads/short-url/btjNvirgUxOMStGesJK10Hp9D3B.csv).
