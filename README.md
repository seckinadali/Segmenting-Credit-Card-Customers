# Segmenting Credit Card Customers

In this project we work with a data set that contains information about a credit card company's customers. We segment the customers into different groups so that different business strategies can be applied to each group. We use K-means algorithm to achieve this task.

The data set we use is a modified version of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/), and was provided by Dataquest as part of one of their guided projects ([link from their community forum](https://community.dataquest.io/uploads/short-url/btjNvirgUxOMStGesJK10Hp9D3B.csv)).
